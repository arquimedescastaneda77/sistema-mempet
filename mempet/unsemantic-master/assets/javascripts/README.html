<p>In this folder, the following JS files are needed only to show the grid dimensions in the demo, and are otherwise not needed for Unsemantic:</p>
<ul>
<li>demo.js</li>
<li>html5.js</li>
<li>jquery.js</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are supporting older browsers with Unsemantic, you <em>may</em> want to use the Adapt.js approach, as seen in the &quot;adapt.html&quot; example file.</p>
<p>However, if you have no need to support IE8 and lower, it is highly recommended that you use this CSS file, as it won&#39;t require JS at all.</p>
